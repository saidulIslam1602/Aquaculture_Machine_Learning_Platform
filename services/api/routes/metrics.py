    Get Real-time Performance Metrics

    Returns actual measured performance statistics from the application.

    Returns:
        Dict containing:
            - latency_mean_ms: Average request latency
            - latency_p50_ms: Median latency (50th percentile)
            - latency_p95_ms: 95th percentile latency
            - latency_p99_ms: 99th percentile latency
            - throughput_rps: Requests per second
            - error_rate: Percentage of failed requests
            - total_requests: Total requests processed
            - uptime_seconds: Application uptime

    Example:
        ```python
        response = requests.get(
            'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metrics/performance',
