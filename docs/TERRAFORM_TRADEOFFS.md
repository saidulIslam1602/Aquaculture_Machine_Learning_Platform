## Cost vs Performance Trade-offs

### Environment-Based Resource Sizing

Our infrastructure uses different resource sizes based on environment to optimize costs while maintaining appropriate performance levels.

#### Development Environment
```hcl
development = {
  eks_node_instance_type = "t3.medium"     # $0.0416/hour
  rds_instance_class    = "db.t3.micro"   # $0.017/hour
  redis_node_type       = "cache.t3.micro" # $0.017/hour
  kafka_instance_type   = "kafka.t3.small" # $0.036/hour
  enable_multi_az       = false           # 50% cost savings
  log_retention_days    = 7               # Minimal storage costs
}
```

#### Production Environment
```hcl
production = {
  eks_node_instance_type = "t3.xlarge"    # $0.1664/hour (4x cost)
  rds_instance_class    = "db.t3.large"   # $0.136/hour (8x cost)
  redis_node_type       = "cache.t3.medium" # $0.068/hour (4x cost)
  kafka_instance_type   = "kafka.m5.large" # $0.192/hour (5x cost)
  enable_multi_az       = true            # 2x cost but high availability
  log_retention_days    = 90              # Higher storage costs
}
```

#### Trade-off Analysis

| Aspect | Development | Production | Impact |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Monthly Cost** | ~$150-250 | ~$800-1500 | 5-6x difference |
| **Performance** | Basic | High | Suitable for each use case |
| **Availability** | Single AZ | Multi-AZ | Dev downtime acceptable |
| **Risk** | Low impact | Business critical | Appropriate protection |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Massive cost savings in development (80%+ reduction)
- ✅ Appropriate performance for each environment's needs
- ✅ Encourages proper environment separation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Development environment may not catch performance issues
- ❌ Potential for "works on my machine" problems
- ❌ Different behavior between environments

**Mitigation:** Staging environment bridges the gap with production-like configuration at medium cost.

## Security vs Complexity Trade-offs

### Layered Security Architecture

Our infrastructure implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers of protection.

#### Network Segmentation
```hcl
# Three-tier network architecture
public_subnets    # Load balancers only (internet-facing)
private_subnets   # Applications (no direct internet access)
database_subnets  # Databases (most isolated)
```

#### Security Group Strategy
```hcl
# Principle of least privilege
aws_security_group.alb      # Internet → Load Balancer
aws_security_group.eks      # Load Balancer → Applications  
aws_security_group.rds      # Applications → Database
aws_security_group.redis    # Applications → Cache
```

#### Enterprise Security Features (Optional)
```hcl
# Basic Security (Default - Lower Complexity)
enable_enterprise_security = false      # No WAF, basic monitoring
enable_enterprise_compliance = false    # No audit trails
enable_enterprise_auth = false          # Basic authentication

# Enterprise Security (Optional - Higher Complexity)
enable_enterprise_security = true       # WAF, GuardDuty, advanced monitoring
enable_enterprise_compliance = true     # CloudTrail, Config, audit logging
enable_enterprise_auth = true           # LDAP, SAML, Secrets Manager
```

#### Trade-off Analysis

| Security Level | Complexity | Monthly Cost | Compliance | Maintenance |
|----------------|------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | Low | +$0-50 | Basic | Minimal |
| **Enhanced** | Medium | +$100-300 | Good | Moderate |
| **Enterprise** | High | +$500-1000 | Excellent | Significant |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Modular approach - add security as needed
- ✅ Clear network boundaries and access controls
- ✅ Industry best practices implemented
- ✅ Compliance-ready architecture

**Cons:**
- ❌ Increased complexity with more security layers
- ❌ Higher costs for enterprise features
- ❌ More components to monitor and maintain
- ❌ Potential for misconfiguration

## Availability vs Cost Trade-offs

### Multi-AZ Deployment Strategy

Different availability requirements based on environment criticality.

#### High Availability Configuration
```hcl
# Production: Maximum availability
multi_az_enabled = true                    # 99.95% availability
automatic_failover_enabled = true          # Automatic recovery
backup_retention_period = 30              # Extended backup retention
deletion_protection = true                 # Prevent accidental deletion

# Development: Cost-optimized
multi_az_enabled = false                   # 99.5% availability  
automatic_failover_enabled = false         # Manual recovery acceptable
backup_retention_period = 7               # Minimal backup retention
deletion_protection = false                # Allow easy cleanup
```

#### EKS Node Scaling Strategy
```hcl
# Development: Minimal resources
min_size = 1, desired_size = 2, max_size = 3

# Production: Robust scaling
min_size = 3, desired_size = 5, max_size = 10
```

#### Trade-off Analysis

| Environment | Availability | Recovery Time | Monthly Cost | Business Impact |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Development** | 99.5% | Hours | $150-250 | Low |
| **Staging** | 99.9% | Minutes | $300-600 | Medium |
| **Production** | 99.95% | Seconds | $800-1500 | High |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Appropriate availability for business needs

## Flexibility vs Complexity Trade-offs

### Module Usage Strategy

Balance between development speed and control.

#### Community Modules (Our Approach)
```hcl

  version = "~> 5.0"
}

module "eks" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"  
  version = "~> 19.0"
}
```

#### Configuration Override System
```hcl
# Environment defaults with override capability
instance_class = coalesce(
  var.force_instance_types.rds,    # Override if specified
  local.config.rds_instance_class  # Environment default
)
```

#### Trade-off Analysis

| Approach | Development Speed | Control Level | Maintenance | Risk |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| **Community Modules** | Fast | Medium | Low | Low |

rds_instance_class = "db.t3.micro"        # Shared CPU, minimal cost

# Production: Dedicated instances
eks_node_instance_type = "t3.xlarge"      # Dedicated CPU, predictable performance
rds_instance_class = "db.t3.large"        # Dedicated resources
kafka_instance_type = "kafka.m5.large"    # Memory-optimized for throughput
```

#### Storage Strategy
```hcl
# Development: Standard storage
allocated_storage = 20                     # Minimal storage
max_allocated_storage = 100               # Limited auto-scaling

# Production: Performance storage  
allocated_storage = 100                    # Adequate baseline
max_allocated_storage = 500               # Generous auto-scaling
```
