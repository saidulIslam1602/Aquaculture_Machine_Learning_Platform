### Expected Performance (Production)

Based on architecture and implementation:
- **API latency**: 30-80ms (p95) - FastAPI + async I/O
- **Inference time**: 50-150ms per image - PyTorch with GPU
- **Throughput**: 500-2000 req/s - With horizontal scaling
- **Database queries**: 5-20ms (p95) - Connection pooling + indexes

Actual performance depends on:
- Hardware (CPU/GPU specs)
- Network latency
- Database load
- Model complexity
- Concurrent users

### Optimization Features
- Redis caching for frequent queries (sub-millisecond)
- Database connection pooling (20 connections)
- Async I/O with FastAPI (non-blocking)
- Model optimization ready (quantization, pruning)
- Batch processing for high throughput (32 images/batch)
- Horizontal pod autoscaling (3-20 replicas)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Style
- Black for formatting
- Flake8 for linting
- mypy for type checking
- isort for import sorting

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "feat: add feature"`
3. Push and create PR: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
4. Wait for CI/CD checks to pass
5. Request review and merge
