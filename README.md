The application tracks and reports:
- **Latency Percentiles**: p50, p95, p99 (measured in real-time)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second (sliding window)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Uptime**: Application uptime in seconds

Example response:
```json
{
  "latency_mean_ms": 45.2,
  "latency_p50_ms": 38.5,
  "latency_p95_ms": 89.3,
  "latency_p99_ms": 145.7,
